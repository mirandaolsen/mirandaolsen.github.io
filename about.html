      <p>
        My name is Miranda Olsen and I am 7 years old. I have a big brother, <a href='https://ulysses-olsen.github.io'>Ulysses</a>, and 2 cats named Zeep and Tiger. I live in Inwood, NYC. My favorite animals are <a href="wolfstory.html">wolves</a>, sabertooth cats, and dragons because theyâ€™re fierce. I spent 2 birthdays at the <a href="https://nywolf.org">Wolf Conservation Center</a>. My birthday is July 26th. I like to play games, read books, go to the park and climb trees, and go to museums and concerts. I am good at climbing trees! I enjoy science and looking at things under microscopes. I play chess on the PS 278 chess team. I take piano lessons, swim lessons and tennis lessons. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. Some of my favorite foods are apples, ice cream, kale, raspberries, peanut butter, and broccoli. I like to go camping with my family, especially in the woods and at the beach. In the year 2017 I went on an <a href='https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/arts/music/erie-canal-bicentennial-albany-symphony.html'>orchestra tour</a> with my family.
