    <p>This is the story of how I came to live among the wolves.</p>
    <p>I have always loved wolves. On my seventh birthday, the <a href='https://nywolf.org'>Wolf Conservation Center</a> (WCC) sent me a letter saying that my family and I could camp there overnight. They knew me because, on my birthday when I was four, instead of presents, I asked for donations for the WCC. When I went there to give them the money, I met <a href='https://nywolf.org/ambassador-wolves/atka'>Atka</a> and <a href='https://nywolf.org/ambassador-wolves/zephyr'>Zephyr</a> for the first time. They are two of the wolves who live there. Zephyr is a Mexican Gray Wolf and Atka is an Arctic gray wolf. There are two other wolves one named Niki the other named Alawa.</p>
