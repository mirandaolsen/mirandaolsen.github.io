        <p>During the summer, we stayed for four days in a house on Block Island because the Kalandadzes said we could stay with them. When we were there, I liked diving into waves more than I had before. Also I was a much better swimmer than I was last summer because of my swim class. I'm a pretty good swimmer. Swiming is SUPER-FUN </p>
