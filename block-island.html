        <p>During the summer, my family and I stayed for four days in a house on <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Island> Block Island </a> because our friends the Kalandadzes said we could stay with them in a house that they are renting. When we were there, I liked diving into waves more than I had before. Also I was a much better swimmer than I was last summer because of my <a href="https://swimjim.com"> swim class</a>. I'm a pretty good swimmer. Swiming is SUPER-FUN.</p>
